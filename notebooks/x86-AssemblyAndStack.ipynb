    "- is the order of sequence of bytes of a digital data stored in computer memory\n",
    "- two types: Big-Endian and Little-Endian\n",
    "- a big-endian stores the **most significant byte** of a word at the smallest memory address and the most significant byte of a word at the largest in 4-byte (32-bit) memory address\n",
    "- a little-endian stores the **least significant byte** of a word at the smallest memory address and the most significant byte of a word at the largest\n",
