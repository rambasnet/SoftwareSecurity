    "- main memory (RAM) is typically divided into 2 main spaces:\n",
    "    1. kernel space - reserved for running the kernel (OS background processes, device drivers, etc.)\n",
    "        - loaded in lower addresses\n",
    "    2. user space - user-mode applications are loaded\n",
    "        - loaded in higher addresses\n",
    "    \n",
    "- in C/C++ programs, user space is divided into 5 different areas, called segments:\n",

    "- also called a code segment\n",
    "- compiled program/code is loaded\n",
    "- code segment is typically read-only\n",

    "### Data segment\n",
    "- also called the initialized data segment\n",

    "### Heap segment\n",
    "- memory for dynamically allocated variables (using pointers) are allocated in this segment\n",
    "- Heap size is normally much larger compared to stack size\n",
    "- size (actual) grows and shrinks based on program needs\n",
    "- programmers repsponsibility to deallocate dynamic memory\n",
    "    - memory leak could occur, otherwise!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Stack segment\n",
    "- also called scratch pad\n",
