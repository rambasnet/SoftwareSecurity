    "## Overview\n",
    "- buffer overflow can happen in other segments such as **global/data** and **bss**\n",
    "- if an important variable is located after a buffer vulnerable to an overflow, the program's control flow can be altered (regardless of the memory segment)\n",
    "    - controls may be limited depending on the variable type and its usage in the program\n",
    "- in this notebook, we will explore overwriting function pointers located in global segment\n",
    "- recall function pointers are pointers that store addresses of functions/code\n",
    "    - see [Function-Pointers notebook](./Function-Pointers.ipynb) for a review\n",
    "- function pointers can be overwritten using overflow techniques to point to different code/function\n",

    "## Lucky 7 game\n",
    "- various luck-based games that're favored to the house\n",
    "- program uses a function pointer to remember the last game played by the user\n",
    "- the last game function's address is stored in the **User** structure\n",
    "- player object is declared as an uninitialized global variable\n",
    "    - meaning the memory is allocated in the **bss** segment\n",
    "- seteuid multi-user program that stores player's data in /var folder\n",
    "- only root or sudo user can access players' info stored in /var folder\n",
    "- each player is identified by the system's user id\n",
    "- examine and compile and run game programs in demos/other_overflow/ folder\n",
    "- game is divided into one header file and 2 .cpp files\n",
    "- use the provided Makefile found in the same folder; uses C++17 specific features such as system specific file permission\n",
    "- NOTE: program must be setuid, to read/write the database file: `/var/lucky7.txt`"
